# Vue.js Beginner
I'll be learning how to use vue.js using "The Majesty of Vue.js" by Alex Kyriakidis

It's a framework I'm looking to use in the future as well as improving my general JS skills. It seems lightweight enough for my needs and where I am now

I *might* try and keep a running diary of my thoughts as I go. But I'm very bad at remembering to update stuff like that, so it probably won't happen!

I'll also be ensuring I comment my code properly.
